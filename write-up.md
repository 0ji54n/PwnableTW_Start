# Writeup for the first challenge on Pwnable.tw: Start

Let's look at the challenge first.

Just that. No hint.

But this's the first one so it should be easy anyway, let's dig deep into.

Connect to the nc server and we have:

It waits for our input, try to put some text, and the connection just close, nothing happened. The **file** command used on the downloaded binary file gives us some information:

Cool. 32-bit so we should use IDA 32 instead of 64.

Open it on IDA and there are only 2 functions: _start and _exit.

The _start function:

Understanding the code in each group in order/ reverse order:
- Push esp, _exit onto the stack, use **XOR** to clean up registers.
- Push the string: `'Let's start the CTF:'` onto the stack. In another word, the $esp register holds the string at this step.
- _0x08048087_ - _0x0804808f_: When you see the `int 0x80`, before it should be a syscall. In this case, al register (8 bits version of eax) is set to 4, so the function wants to call sys_write here. 

`ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);`

`write() writes up to count bytes from the buffer starting at buf to the file referred to by the file descriptor fd.`

_write(2) â€” Linux manual page_

The fd, in this case, is set to 1 (mov bl,1), which means it wants the program to print the output to STDOUT instead of file(s).

`mov bl, 0x14`: size of the string it wants to print.

`mov ecx, esp`: exc will hold "Let's start the CTF:" from now on and parse to write() as `const void *buf`.

- _0x08048091_ - _0x08048097_: This time, the al is set to 3, which means it wants to call sys_read.

`ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);`

`read() attempts to read up to count bytes from file descriptor fd into the buffer starting at buf.`

_read(2) - Linux manual page_

`XOR ebx, ebx`: Clean up register.

`mov dl, 0x3C`: Read 60 bytes from STDINT.
