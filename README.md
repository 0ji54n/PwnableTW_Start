# Writeup for the first challenge on Pwnable.tw: Start

Let's look at the challenge first.

Just that. No hint.

But this's the first one so it should be easy anyway, let's dig deep into.

Connect to the nc server and we have:

It waits for our input, try to put some text, and the connection just close, nothing happened. The **file** command used on the downloaded binary file gives us some information:

Cool. 32-bit so we should use IDA 32 instead of 64.

Open it on IDA and there are only 2 functions: _start and _exit.

The _start function:

Understanding the code in order:
- Push esp, _exit onto the stack, use **XOR** to clean up registers.
- Push the string: `'Let's start the CTF:'` onto the stack.
- _0x08048087_ - _0x0804808f_: When you see the `int 0x80`, before it should be a syscall. In this case, al register (8 bits version of eax) is set to 4, so the function want to call sys_write here. 

`ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);`(write(2) â€” Linux manual page)

The fd, in this case, is set to 1, which means it wants the program to print the output to STDOUT instead of file(s).
